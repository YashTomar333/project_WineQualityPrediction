OBJECTIVE :- Here we will predict the quality of wine on the basis of given features using SVM(Support Vector Classifier) and Logistic Regression.  
<br>  
DATA SOURCE :- We use the wine quality dataset provided by YBI Foundation through its DataSets GitHub Repository. This dataset has the fundamental features which are responsible for affecting the quality of the wine. By the use of SVM and Logistic Regression, we will predict the quality of the wine.
